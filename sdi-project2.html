<p>A typical workday for me starts once I arrive at the office around 8:30 AM. I unload my purse.  I turn my computer on to see if a patch was received from our Corporate Information Systems. If my computer received a patch, I reboot my machine and go downstairs to get breakfast in our cafe while my machine boots up. If I did not receive a patch, I review my email briefly before grabbing breakfast. If my inbox consists of junk mail, I delete the messages and continue to review. If my inbox consists of urgent requests, I respond promptly for assistance. Once my inbox has been cleaned out, I run downstairs and grab breakfast.</p>
